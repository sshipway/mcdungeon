# Items in this file are loaded in addition to those in the normal items.txt
# This file is ideal for adding mod items for loot.
# 
# Format is:
# ID,Item Name,Data Value,Maximum Stack Size

# The Lucky Block
# This is 850 in older versions, but in MC1.7 it dynamically changes
# depending on what modules are currently loaded.  If you have no other
# block-creating modules, it will likely be 165
# You can use this definition rather than the customised items/lucky_block.nbt
# file ( file_lucky_block ) if you want, but you will then get the 
# default possible outcomes list.
