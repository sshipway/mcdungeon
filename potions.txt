# Potions
# 
# These are potions with custom effects that can be referenced in loot tables.
#
# =======
#
# The format for potions with multiple effects is:
# <name>,<effect id>-<level>-<duration>,<effect id>-<level>-<duration>...<,flag (optional)>
# 
# The format for 'basic' potions with only one effect is:
# <name>,<effect name><,flag (optional)>
#
# When providing multiple potion effects groups of three values are
# required: the id, level and duration. Duration is the time of the effect
# in game ticks. (20 ticks = 1 second, 1200 ticks = 1 minute)
# Potion Data values and effect ids can be found on the minecraft wiki,
# * http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Potions
# * http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Potion_effect
#
# When just one effect is needed, use the potion effect string. Values can
# be found on the minecraft wiki: http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Potion#Data_values
#
# The flag can be omitted. Use HIDE_EFFECTS to hide the potion effects
# in-game, HIDE_PARTICLES to hide the player particles after drinking, or
# HIDE_ALL to hide both. HIDE_PARTICLES does not work with 'basic' potions.
#
# For each entry in this file, FOUR items will be created that can be
# referenced in loot tables. 1) The potion itself, 2) The splash version of
# the potion, prefixed by 'splash', 3) The tipped arrow version, with the
# suffix 'arrow' and 4) The lingering version, prefixed by 'lingering'.
# For example, "Potion of XXX" would also produce:
#  - Splash Potion of XXX
#  - Potion of XXX arrow
#  - Lingering Potion of XXX
